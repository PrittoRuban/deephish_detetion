# Phishing & Deepfake Detection

Hi, I'm **Pritto Ruban**, and this project is all about using AI to fight digital deception — from phishing scams to deepfake media. It’s built to help users detect suspicious links, manipulated videos, AI-generated images, and cloned audio.

The goal? Make the web a little safer and smarter.

## Why I Built This

With AI tools becoming more accessible, it’s easier than ever to create fake content — which means we need better tools to detect it. This project brings together what I’ve learned in machine learning, full-stack development, and cybersecurity into something practical and helpful.

It’s meant to educate, protect, and show how AI can be used *against* digital threats, not just to create them.
